/* ISP latch kick. Several ISP settings only take effect while framesource chn0

 * the driver until chn0 pumps a couple of frames. With the on-demand FS above,
 * chn0 is idle whenever nothing subscribes (and, crucially, at boot before any
 * client connects), so the queued change never latches.
 *
 * Two settings in this class are known:
 *  - running_mode (day/night): root-caused on cam-L Y4 (T23 / sc2336, ISP
 *    H20241028a / isp_20250722a) 2026-08-01 - the dusk switch-to-night plus BOTH
 *    daynight re-asserts returned rc=0 with chn0 idle, /proc/jz/isp/isp-m0
 *    stayed "Runing Mode : Day", and the always-on ch1 substream showed the
 *    magenta IR-in-colour-mode image all evening. Merely enabling chn0 (a
 *    snapshot) latched the queued mode within a couple of frames, no further Set.
 *  - image.hflip / image.vflip: same class, found 2026-08-09 on the same board.
 *    apply_image_tuning() sets the flip at boot (isp_init) BEFORE any FS exists,
 *    and it is never re-applied when the FS later starts, so with chn0 idle the
 *    flip never latches: the sensor comes up UNFLIPPED despite hflip=1/vflip=1
 *    (image upside-down), and only a live /control POST landing while the WebUI
 *    preview streams chn0 makes it take effect. RTSP masks a resulting constant
 *    A/V-independent orientation; the operator sees "live flip works, boot flip
 *    doesn't" for the same 1/1 values.
 *
 * A SECOND, distinct failure mode in the same latch class: a value that DID
 * latch can silently REVERT with no new Set involved. Observed live on cam-L
 * 2026-08-09 (see fs_use for the incident detail) coinciding with a chn0
 * idle->active cycle; IMP_FrameSource_DisableChn/EnableChn on chn0 - the normal
 * on-demand idle->active cycle (last viewer leaves, chn0 idles after
 * MS_IDLE_STOP_US, a later viewer re-enables it; also the video/jpeg watchdog
 * recovery cycle and a motion (re)pin on stream 0) - is the leading suspect for
 * resetting the ISP flip/running_mode latch, but a running_mode/day-night
 * switch resetting the flip independently of any chn0 edge has not been ruled
 * out either (hence the belt-and-braces re-assert in ing_control()). Either
 * way this is NOT an "apply while idle" case - no new Set is issued - so the
 * kick machinery here does not cover it. fs_use() now self-heals the chn0-edge
 * case directly: every genuine chn0 0->1 enable edge re-applies hflip/vflip/
 * running_mode under g_isp_lock. So the kick callers below - ing_control_commit()'s
 * pending flag, ing_start()'s boot-time kick, ing_control()'s inline running_mode
 * kick - remain necessary for the "apply a value while chn0 is genuinely idle
 * with nobody about to consume frames" case (a /control POST while no one is
 * watching); the idle->active-cycle case is now also handled automatically by
 * fs_use().
 *
 * So: after applying any of these, run chn0 for a few frames if it is idle.
 * Refcounted fs_use makes this a cheap ref bump / no-op when chn0 is already
 * streaming (a subscriber, or a motion pin on stream 0). ~500 ms = ~12 frames
 * @25fps, generous margin over the 1-2 frames the latch needs. Callers must NOT
 * hold g_isp_lock (fs_use -> IMP_FrameSource_EnableChn must not race an ISP Set
 * under that lock; and fs_use() now takes g_isp_lock itself on the chn0 enable
 * edge, so a caller already holding it would deadlock). */

/* ============ image.ae_it_max_us: frame-driven cap supervisor ============
 *
 * The AE integration-time cap is the one ISP key whose Set is honoured only
 * while the pipeline is genuinely DELIVERING frames to a consumer - not merely
 * while framesource chn0 is enabled. Measured on cam-garage (T31X / sc4336p,
 * ISP H20221206a) 2026-09-06:
 *   - written into an idle pipeline (boot, or a /control POST with nobody
 *     watching), IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetAe_IT_MAX returns 0 and GetExpr echoes the
 *     new maximum straight back, but /proc/jz/isp/isp-m0's "SENSOR Max
 *     Integration Time" never moves, a later kick does not rescue it, and
 *     within a couple of minutes even the GetExpr echo has decayed back to the
 *     sensor default;
 *   - the identical write issued while an RTSP client was already pulling chn0
 *     took effect on the spot, /proc following within one sample (1496 -> 545
 *     lines for a 12 ms cap).
 * The first attempt at a boot path (isp_ae_it_max_latch(), removed in favour of
 * this) tried to fake the second state: fs_use(0), sleep, Set, sleep,
 * fs_unuse(0). It does not work, at 0.3 s or at 2.5 s of pump, and a real
 * client streaming for a full minute afterwards still read 1496 - because
 * fs_use() only ENABLES the framesource. Nobody consumed those frames, so the
 * pipeline was never in the state that makes the SDK honour the write, and
 * sizing the sleep up cannot fix a pipeline that is not delivering.
 *
 * So the write is driven from the real frame path instead: the encode threads
 * call ae_it_max_on_frame() after each frame they have actually pulled from the
 * encoder and published, which is by construction the same state a live
 * /control POST lands in - the one state that is measured to work. Nothing
 * else in the ISP block needs this; hflip/vflip/running_mode latch off a mere
 * enable (fs_kick_chn0), which is why they are not routed through here.
 *
 * A supervisor rather than a one-shot, because the cap can be lost again with
 * no Set of ours involved: a chn0 disable/enable cycle resets it (same class as
 * the flip latch, see fs_use - previously a KNOWN GAP with no fix, now closed
 * by the arm there), and an ignored write's GetExpr echo decays. Verification
 * is the readback through the same accessor daynight uses: the cap is "in
 * effect" while GetExpr's own maximum is at or below what was asked for, which
 * also makes the clamped "asking for more than the sensor mode's own maximum"
 * case self-satisfying (isp_apply_image writes nothing there).
 *
 * Cost on the frame path: one int compare per published frame, one clock read
 * per AE_IT_MIN_FRAMES frames, and one GetExpr per AE_IT_HOLD_US once the cap
 * holds. While it does NOT hold, it is one GetExpr + one re-write per
 * AE_IT_SETTLE_US, backing off to AE_IT_SLOW_US after AE_IT_LOUD_TRIES so a SoC
 * that never honours the cap costs a log line every few minutes, not a stream.
 *
 * Not covered: a pipeline whose only frame consumer is motion detection (IVS
 * pulls frames with no encoder running, in imp_motion.c). The cap then waits
 * for the first real video/JPEG client. */

 * offset+length > streamSize cannot come out of that.
 *
 * For C100/T40/T41 it stays unverified - T41 1.2.5 exports a function of the

 * check. The cheap remSize idiom would decouple the assumption from the libimp

 * lost no samples (the AI FIFO buffered and burst them) looked like a gap and
 * inserted phantom samples -> permanent audio drift (A1).
 *
 * The encoder/AI hands us the true per-frame capture time
 * (IMPEncoderPack.timestamp / IMPFrameInfo.timeStamp / IMPAudioFrame.timeStamp,
 * unit us); its inter-frame deltas are the correct, jitter-free media clock, and
 * those deltas ARE exactly the signal the gap heuristics need. We do NOT trust
 * it blindly:
 *
 *  - Absolute base: libimp's timestamp base is not guaranteed to equal
 *    CLOCK_MONOTONIC (ms_now_us). rtp.c's RTCP Sender Report pairs ms_now_us()
 *    ("now") against the track's first pts (pts0); a pts0 on a foreign base
 *    would corrupt the NTP<->RTP mapping and A/V lip-sync. So we keep the media
 *    timeline ON the ms_now_us base: the first frame anchors at now_us and every
 *    later frame adds the hardware DELTA via a fixed offset (now0 - hw0). Any
 *    constant base difference cancels out; only the jitter-free deltas survive.
 *    Because the base is unchanged, no downstream consumer (RTP SR, fMP4 tfdt,
 *    recorder, SRT PES) sees a timebase shift - only the jitter is removed.
 *
 *  - Reliability: on some SoC/libimp builds the field can be 0, frozen, or
 *    garbage. We accept the hardware-derived value only while it is strictly
 *    monotonic AND within +/-skew_max_us of the wall clock. A genuine stall
 *    advances BOTH clocks, so a real multi-second gap is preserved and stays
 *    aligned with audio_gap_resync(); a frozen/garbage value diverges from the
 *    wall clock and is rejected. (This wall-clock cross-check replaces a raw
 *    ">N s jump" rule on purpose - a delta threshold cannot tell a real long
 *    stall, which we must preserve to stay A/V-aligned, from garbage, which we
 *    must reject.) On rejection we snap the pts to the wall clock (now_us, hard
 *    ratchet-stop so a fast burst of rejected frames can never accumulate a
 *    forward lead) and re-seat the offset so a later good frame re-locks the hw
 *    clock.
 *
 *  - Self-correction: a diverged-but-still-under-skew_max hw clock used to stay
 *    locked in forever (the accept path froze pts_offset). Since video and audio
 *    use different skew_max, one track could hold a drift the other rejected ->
 *    a permanent A/V skew. The accept path now SLEWS pts_offset back toward the
 *    zero-skew value at a tiny capped per-frame rate whenever the drift is
 *    non-trivial (see PTS_SLEW_* below), so no track can stay locked to a
 *    drifted clock. Convergence is gradual (invisible per frame), not a step.
 *
 * skew_max_us bounds the legitimate capture-vs-publish lag: video uses ~1 s
 * (encoder backlog can be large); audio uses a tighter bound sized to the AI
 * FIFO depth (MS_AI_FRM_DEPTH frames ~160 ms) plus the AAC accumulator, since
 * audio's hardware FIFO caps how far a legitimate burst can lag and a looser
 * bound would only let more garbage through.
 *
 * Always returns a strictly-increasing pts on the ms_now_us() timebase. */
/* Self-correction slew (accept path), shared by both streams:
 *  - DEADBAND: only correct a genuine hw-vs-wall DRIFT, not per-frame jitter.
 *    Steady-state skew is jitter-scale (a few ms - the offset is anchored to the
 *    capture cadence, not the absolute latency), so 50 ms sits well above it:
 *    the offset stays frozen in normal operation and cand keeps the smooth,
 *    jitter-free capture clock. Only a real drift event pushes skew past this.
 *  - MAX: per-frame offset step cap. 1 ms << any real frame interval (>=~8 ms
 *    at 120 fps), so it is invisible per frame and always leaves a large
 *    monotonicity margin. Convergence rate = MAX * fps (e.g. 25 ms/s at 25 fps,
 *    ~2.5% playback deviation during recovery); a ~0.9 s drift decays to the
 *    deadband in ~34 s. Tunable: raise MAX for faster recovery, lower for a
 *    gentler slew. */

#ifdef ROT_HAS_SW_90
/* ================= software 90/270 rotate (Batch 5, T23 opt-in) =============
 * The T23 has no I2D block and its libimp has no FrameSource rotate, but the
 * shipped libimp 1.3.0 EXPORTS the unbound YUV encode API (IMP_Encoder_YuvInit/
 * YuvEncode/YuvExit/YuvRequestIDR + VbmAlloc/VbmFree/VbmV2P - verified against
 * dl/ingenic-lib T23 1.3.0 and include/T23/1.3.0/en/imp/imp_encoder.h). So a
 * 90/270 stream runs UNBOUND: framesource at the pre-rotation dims with a user
 * frame depth, sw_rot_thread GetFrame -> nv12_rotate90 into a phys-contiguous
 * bounce buffer -> software OSD -> IMP_Encoder_YuvEncode -> hub_publish.
 * Everything downstream (RTSP/fMP4/hub/record) already works from the eff
 * (rotated) dims + SPS-derived params, so nothing else changes.
 *
 * Costs/limitations of this path (all logged at start):
 *   - CPU: a full NV12 transpose per frame on the single MIPS core. Anything
 *     beyond ~704x576@15 (substream class) will eat the core - warned, not
 *     refused (the build knob is the operator's opt-in to that cost).
 *   - no HARDWARE OSD or privacy covers (no OSD group to splice in). Text OSD
 *     is composited in software below (5b); privacy covers are NOT drawn on
 *     this stream (future item).
 *   - no piggyback JPEG (videoN.jpeg) on this stream: the piggyback encoder
 *     registers into the video's encoder GROUP, which does not exist here.
 *   - IVS motion on this stream sees the UNROTATED frame (grid coords are
 *     pre-rotation).
 * OUTPUT-BUFFER CONTRACT (established by disassembling the T23 1.3.0
 * libimp.so, dl/ingenic-lib): IMPEncoderYuvOut is an IN/OUT parameter. The
 * CALLER must pass a valid 4-byte-aligned buffer in out.outAddr and its
 * capacity in out.outLen. Per frame, i264e_update_fenc (@0x3484c) sets the
 * raw bitstream area to outAddr+0x1080 / outLen-0x1080 (the Yuv path sets the
 * "external buffer" flag, so i264e_init allocates NO internal bitstream buf,
 * @0x3aa48), and i264e_encoder_encapsulate_nals (@0x38664, ext branch
 * @0x38840) escapes the final Annex-B AU contiguously to outAddr+0. On return
 * YuvEncode overwrites out.outLen with the AU length (sum of NAL sizes,
 * @0x58fb8) and leaves out.outAddr untouched. Passing a zeroed struct makes
 * libimp deref NULL+0x1080 -> SIGSEGV at load-offset 0x3d8dc (bs init in
 * i264e_encode, delay slot of the jalr). The AU in ybuf stays valid until the
 * next YuvEncode call (hub_publish copies it out immediately). Also per
 * disasm: the encode is pure SOFTWARE (i264e) and reads the input frame via
 * frame.virAddr only (frame.phyAddr is never read, @0x58f24), and the Yuv API
 * accepts PT_H264 ONLY - PT_H265 is a log-and-fail stub in both YuvInit
 * (@0x5874c) and YuvEncode (@0x5901c). */

         * sc2336, 2026-08-18): what this loop is handed is the SENSOR rate, not
         * videoN.fps. video1 = 640x480@15 rotated 90: fs_create() set
         * outFrmRateNum=15 and YuvInit was told 15 (so SPS and container both
         * advertise 15), yet the stream delivered 29.85 fps over 60 s - the full
         * 30 fps sensor rate - while the BOUND channel 0 delivered its
         * configured 25 (24.88 measured) at the same moment. The framesource
         * rate divider is therefore honoured for a bound consumer but NOT for a
         * user-mode GetFrame consumer: the same class of gap as the missing HW
         * OSD / privacy / piggyback-JPEG on this path. There is no SDK call to
         * reach for either - T23 1.3.0 exports no IMP_FrameSource_SetFrameRate
         * (imp_framesource.h has CreateChn/SetChnAttr and no per-channel rate
         * call), and SetChnAttr's outFrmRateNum is precisely the field already
         * proven not to reach this consumer. So the rate is enforced in this
         * loop.
         *
         * What it cost while unenforced, same board: the transpose and the
         * software encode ran at 2x the intended rate (sw_rot_thread at 39% of
         * the lone core for 480x640, against ~21% total daemon CPU for the same
         * stream unrotated); rate control was parameterised for 15 fps and fed
         * 30; and the safe envelope in sw_rot_start - which gates on the
         * CONFIGURED <=704x576 / <=15 fps - did not bound what this thread
         * actually did. Under 5 clients delivery came in bursts (ffmpeg reported
         * ~14.6 non-monotonic DTS/s on the rotated stream against 0.03/s
         * unrotated), consistent with a CPU-saturated path draining a capture
         * backlog in gulps.
         *
         * The gate drops surplus frames immediately after GetFrame and BEFORE
         * nv12_rotate90, so a dropped frame costs one GetFrame/ReleaseFrame pair
         * and nothing else: the transpose, the software encode, the OSD
         * composite, the JPEG and the publish all run at the configured rate. It
         * is a ceiling and never a source of latency - if a future libimp ever

         *    704x576 envelope limit) while ->len is the real AU: measured mean
         *    2.7 KB, P-frames ~2.2 KB, IDR ~34 KB. Publishing such a packet
         *    breaks the invariant the fan-out's only memory backstop rests on,
         *    cap ~= len: fanqueue's FQ_MAX_BYTES budget accounts ->len, so ONE
         *    stalled client would pin slots*cap - 64 * 304 KiB = 19 MiB
         *    (RTSP) or 128 * 304 KiB = 38 MiB (record ring) - on a board with
         *    37 MiB of usable RAM and ~3.4 MiB free. The budget cannot see it.
         *  - Leaving HUB_POOL_KEEP_CAP (96 KB) alone instead frees every
         *    returned buffer, i.e. a 304 KiB malloc+free PER FRAME: measured
         *    96.0 us/frame = 1.44 ms/s, against the 4.3 us/frame = 64 us/s the
         *    copy actually costs (malloc+memcpy+free at the mean AU size, same
         *    board). The "zero-copy" variant would be 23x more expensive than
         *    the copy it removes.
         *  - The copy is also what lets the encoder keep ONE output buffer and
         *    reuse it next call. Rotating out.outAddr per frame through a
         *    black-box software encoder is unverified: the disassembly shows
         *    the buffer being re-armed per frame (i264e_update_fenc), which is
         *    not a guarantee that a different address per call is supported.
         *
         * So the copy stays: 15 fps * 2.7 KB = 40 KB/s, ~64 us/s = 0.006% of
         * the core, against the ~39% of the core this thread measurably spends
         * on nv12_rotate90 + the software encode. If this path ever needs CPU
         * back, those two are the targets - not this memcpy. Same reasoning,
         * only more so, for the JPEG publish further down (jbuf_cap is
         * 2*ew*eh + 64 KiB = 664 KiB against a measured ~25 KiB JPEG).
         * ORDERING GUARD for anyone revisiting this: the copy is the LAST
         * step of the frame, long after the composition above - rotate
         * (nv12_rotate90) -> software OSD onto the ROTATED bounce in EFF
         * coordinates (sw_osd_compose, fw/fh = vc->w/vc->h) -> YuvEncode.
         * Nothing about a pooled-output variant would move that: it would
         * only change where the ENCODED BITSTREAM lands, never where or in
         * which geometry the OSD is composited. Any future attempt here must
         * keep that order intact - compositing before the rotate, or against

         * read upright and are anchored to the ROTATED frame's top edge.
