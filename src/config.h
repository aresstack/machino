     * currency: the AE answers the shortfall with gain instead, so a capped
     * night frame is sharper and noisier. There is no free version of this.
     *
     * Microseconds, not sensor lines, deliberately: the SDK works in lines,
     * but a line is a property of the sensor mode and frame rate, so the same
     * line count means different exposures on two cameras and even on one
     * camera across a mode change. The HAL converts using the SDK's own
     * one_line_expr_in_us at apply time and clamps into the sensor's real
     * [min,max] range.
     *
     * Two things measured on hardware (T31X/sc4336p) that a caller has to know:
     *  - The write only takes while chn0 is genuinely DELIVERING frames to a
     *    consumer: a POST landing while something is watching takes effect on
     *    the next sample, whereas an apply into an idle pipeline (boot, or a
     *    POST with nobody watching) is accepted, echoed back by GetExpr, and
     *    silently ignored by the sensor. The HAL therefore re-applies the cap
     *    from the encode threads' own frame-delivery path and verifies it by
     *    readback, so a persisted value takes hold as soon as the first real
     *    client streams after boot - typically within ~30 s of that client
     *    connecting. See ae_it_max_on_frame() for the full measurement.
     *  - Within one daemon lifetime the cap only ratchets DOWN. Once a cap is
     *    in force GetExpr reports it as the sensor mode's maximum, so raising
     *    the value again reads as "above the maximum, nothing to cap" and 0 has
     *    no restore call at all: both need a restart to take effect.
     *  - It MOVES daynight's exposure index. The index is gain x
     *    (integration_time / max), and capping the maximum makes the AE rail
     *    against it sooner and answer the shortfall with gain, so a camera
     *    running this key needs its daynight.*_gain thresholds re-checked
     *    rather than inherited. */

     * GPIO on every camera measured, independent of the IR-cut motor, so it
     * can be switched off for a few seconds without an audible click and

     *

     * r >> 1  removing the IR made the scene much darker: the illuminator was

     *         is day - whatever the absolute level happens to be.

     * That last clause is the whole reason this exists. Genuine daylight
     * measured across this fleet at ONE instant spanned a factor of 63, and a
     * single camera swung by 4.5x within one overcast morning, so no absolute
     * day threshold can be right everywhere. Two measured events settle it:
     * an outbuilding light produced a day-pipeline reading of ~3700 and a
