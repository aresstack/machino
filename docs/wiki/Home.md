# timps wiki

**timps** ("Tiny IMP Streamer") is a lightweight, dependency-light RTSP /
fragmented-MP4 / MJPEG streaming daemon for Ingenic T-series SoC IP cameras.
It is built directly on the vendor `libimp` SDK — no live555, libconfig,
libwebsockets or libschrift — and is designed as a drop-in alternative to
[prudynt-t](https://github.com/themactep/prudynt-t) / raptor within the
[thingino](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware) firmware
ecosystem.

This wiki is a curated, evergreen reference for developers and operators. It
is distinct from `docs/*.md` at the repository root, which are historical
investigation notes, build-hardening logs and one-off code audits — those are
linked from here where they contain relevant deep-dive detail, but this wiki
is the place to start.

> Every page in this wiki is written against, and verified against, the
> actual source in `src/` on `main`.

## What timps does

- **RTSP** (port 554, TCP interleaved or UDP transport; RTSPS on port 322
  when built with `USE_TLS`) — H.264 always, H.265 where the SoC/SDK
  supports it, AAC or G.711 (µ-law/A-law) audio.
- **Browser preview over fragmented MP4** (`/stream.mp4`, `/`) — MSE-compatible
  fMP4 muxing for `ffplay`/VLC and `<video>`/MSE in a browser, with audio.
- **MJPEG** (`/stream.mjpeg`) and **JPEG snapshot** (`/snapshot.jpg`).
- **SRT output** (`USE_SRT`) — MPEG-TS over SRT, as a listener
  (`srt.mode=listener`, the default; e.g. `ffplay srt://<ip>:9000`) or as a
  caller dialling out to `srt.host` (`srt.mode=caller`).
- **On-demand encoding** — a stream's encoder only runs while at least one
  client is subscribed; idle streams cost ~0% CPU.
- **Live control API** (`/control`, `USE_CONTROL`) — read and change ISP
  image tuning, audio, OSD, motion and more without a restart, with changes
  persisted back to the config file.
- **Event push** (`/events`, Server-Sent Events) — subscribe to motion,
  day/night and stats updates instead of polling.
- **Grid-based motion detection** built on the Ingenic IVS ("Intelligent
  Video System") hardware move-detection API.
- **Automatic day/night switching**, replacing thingino's separate
  `daynightd` daemon: an `auto` sensor automaton (four independent
  day/probe/heartbeat/boot paths) with an optional calendar, or a
  calendar-only `schedule` mode. See [Day/Night](Day-Night.md).
- **Local recording** (continuous or motion-triggered fMP4 segments to SD)
  and **timelapse** (periodic JPEG capture).
- **Native speaker output** (`IMP_AO`) for an ONVIF-style two-way audio
  backchannel and a system-sound play queue — no external `/bin/iac`/`play`
  helper needed.
- **Privacy masks**, **per-stream TrueType OSD overlays**, and **image
  rotation** (hardware 90/270/180 on some SoCs, software 90/270 on others).
- **Authentication**: RTSP Digest, HTTP Basic, and a token mechanism for the
  HTTP media/API endpoints, with a localhost bypass for on-device UIs.

## Supported platforms

T10 · T20 · T21 · T23 · T30 · T31 · T40 · T41 · C100 (Ingenic SoC families).
See [Platform & SDK Support](Platform-SDK-Support.md) for the capability
matrix (two encoder-API generations, per-SoC rotation tiers, ISP tuning
availability) and links to the deeper `docs/sdk-feature-gaps.md` and
`docs/rotation.md` investigations.
